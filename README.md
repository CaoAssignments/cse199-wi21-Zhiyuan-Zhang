There are two solutions for each problem. The commented ones are my solutions and the rest is solutions posted onliine. You can compare the different approaches in each problem.

**Problem 1: Team Tic Tac Toe**
###### Hashset

The online solution is more basic, it involves a lot of string comparisons that can be very time inefficient. On the other hand, I used HashSet data structure which saved a lot of time and space. Therefore, besides knowing how to construct strings from input chars and comparing strings using nested for loop, HashSet can be very helpful in this kind of problem.

**Problem 2: Milking Order**
###### ArrayList
###### functions related to Arrays

For this problem, my solution is much simpler than the online version. It is basically about managing arrays and find the first empty spot. From the online solution, I saw that it used arraylist and some functions relating to arrays so I think that it can be necessary for students to know.

**Problem 3: Family Tree**
###### HashMap
###### Inner class
###### ArrayList

This problem is pretty tricky. You can either solving it by managing arrays and arraylists or using hashmaps and inner node classes like the online solution did. I feel like my way is easier, but it does help if the students know about using hashmaps and node inner class.
